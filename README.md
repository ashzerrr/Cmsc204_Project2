This project provides a Notation class that converts and evaluates mathematical expressions in different notational formats. It focuses on infix-to-postfix conversion, postfix-to-infix conversion, and evaluating postfix expressions. Through the use of stacks and queues, this project demonstrates the fundamentals of expression parsing and the logic required to handle operator precedence and associativity.
